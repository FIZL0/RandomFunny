Gets random meme

Doesn't work, I can't get it to launch properly so I can't even make sure everything works correctly

Basically I'm trying to use https://meme-api.com/gimme
and get a random meme from reddit to show in the app. I will add some more features (maybe saving the images to another tab) if I can get that working initially
